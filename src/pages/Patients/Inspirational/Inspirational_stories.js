                          Dmitry Knyazev has been a DDI Instructor and an

                          Since becoming a disabled diving instructor, Dmitry
                          has been on a quest to get as many people with
                          disabilities in the water as possible and has been a

                        stories about how people with disabilities overcome the
                        limits of their reality. As Dmitry was already an avid
                        professional diver, he chose diving as the challenge.
                        Each project participant has their own challenge and
                        purpose for taking part. Dmitry documents the
