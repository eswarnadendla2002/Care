                        There is no way to measure the physical and mental
                        strain brought on by lower limb amputation. Blatchford
                        believes caring for someone means always keeping their
                        best interests at heart. For more than 130 years they
                        have maintained a continuous relationship directly with
                        the people who use artificial lower limbs.
                        Blatchford&#39;s caring, innovative spirit helps them to
                        build these types of relationships.

                        The Orthotic &amp; Prosthetic Activities Foundation
                        (OPAF) is a nonprofit organization, a 501(c) (3) public
                        charity, established and incorporated in January 1995 by
                        the former Orthotics and Prosthetics National Office.
                        The Orthotics and Prosthetics National Office is now
                        three separate organizations including The American
                        Orthotic and Prosthetic Association (AOPA), The American
                        Academy of Orthotists and Prosthetists (AAOP) and The
                        American Board for Certification in Orthotics,
                        Prosthetics and Pedorthics (ABC). Each of these
                        organizations still supports OPAF through both financial
                        and in-kind support. OPAF was initially dedicated to
                        providing financial and in-kind support to the 1996
                        Paralympics, OPAF now generates its own initiatives
                        through partnerships with individuals, organizations,
                        and institutions engaged in:
